            parameter.

        registryIP:8282/delete -> uses post headers to delete a specific service earlier registered at the 
            registry unit. Registry unit responds with OK or NOT_OK followed by an error code

            unit. Registry unit responds with OK or NOT_OK followed by an error code

        registryIP:8282/getServices -> returns a list of all services currently registered at the registry unit.
    
        registryIP:8282/getAggregators -> returns a list of all available aggregators.
        
        registryIP:8282/describe/serviceID ->  returns a description provided from the aggregator at register 
            time for service with id serviceID. It should be noted that an aggregator does not need to 
            know of the services' IDs as they are used only by the registry unit to denote  different services.
        
        registryIP:8282/describe/aggregatorID/path/service -> Same as before, but with different notation for ease 
        of use
