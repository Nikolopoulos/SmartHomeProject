# JavaSensorThingyForCommandLine
Sensor aggregator for over serial communications

# So here's the thing
Apparently the serial reading capabilities of JAVA were botched by Oracle. Or Sun. Someone, for what matters. There are quite some implementations of how to do your serial communications but not many work. 
By using the correct library for your arch etc you can do serial stuff!

You'll find the amass of libraries in the folder, LIBRARIES (*gasp*) and a project to understand how to use this newfound power.
